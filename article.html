        Tourism has always been an important industry for Sri Lanka, with it being the 3rd largest foreign
        exchange earner, bringing in an annual $4.4 billion. The livelihood of many people depends on this 
        industry. However, given the current situation of the world as well as past events occured within the 
        country itself, the industry is facing some dark times.

        Tourism in Sri Lanka suffered the initial hut during April of 2019. The aftermath of the terrorist
        bombings of hotel, resulted in Sri Lanka being put on the no-fly list by many other countries' due to 
        arising security concerns. This obviously meant that tourism suffered a huge hit resulting in the many 
        businesses losing most of their income causing wages to be slashed and employees being laid off industry
        wide. The seeming recovery from this tragedy was then curtailed by the outbreak of COVID-19 world-wide and
        is still rampant.

        Measures taken by the government during the terrorist crisis and strategies implemented helped the Sri Lankan
        tourist industry to recover, but currently that recovery has halted and there seems to be no end in sight for 
        the virus itself, thus, the future of the tourism industry remains uncentain. Though the control of the spread 
        within Sri Lanka as well as policies implemented has made Sri Lanka one of the less effected from the pademic,
        and the same spirit shown at the end of the terroist crisis gives Sri Lanka hope, and given the end of the 
        pandemic may re-establish itself as paradise on Earth
